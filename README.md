In the field of low power wireless networks, one of the techniques on which many researchers are putting their efforts is 
related to positioning methodologies such as fingerprinting in dense urban areas. This Mathlab code is an experimental study 
aimed at quantifying the mean location estimation error in densely urbanized areas.
Using a dataset made available by the University of Antwerp, a neural network was implemented with the aim of providing the 
position of the end-devices. In this way it was possible to measure the mean location estimation error in an area with high 
urban density. The results obtained show an accuracy in the localization of the end-device of less than 150 meters with 
possibilities of further improvements.

This result would make it possible to use the fingerprint instead of alternative, energy consuming, methodologies such as GPS 
in IoT (Internet of Things) applications where battery life is the primary requirement to be met.
